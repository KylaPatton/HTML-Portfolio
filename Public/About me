        <hr />
        <p>My name is Kyla Patton, I am a Registered Nurse living in Fernie, BC. I love being creative and enjoy photography in my spare time. I also have always enjoyed using technology and learning what I can use it for and how I can make it work to my advantage. I have decided to pursue education and experience in the web development and graphic design areas. I intend to use this portfolio as a place to display what I learn along the way. </p>
